# Connect4Bot
A simple bot written in C# using alpha beta pruning, with an interface designed for the competition at theaigames.com.

The heuristic it uses is pretty basic when it comes to assessing a current or future game state, but since this is more of a proof of concept project I felt there was no reason to work hard at said aspect of the program.
